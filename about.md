Hello, I'm Yuhuan Qiu.

I study Computer Science mostly at Cornell in Ithaca, NY.

Currently, I'm a TA for CS 2800 - Discrete Structures, and an undergraduate
research assistant in computational biology.

I'm most interested in building things, and learning along the way.

Recently, I've grown quite fond of functional programming, specifically in
OCaml. I find that I'm often more able to express my thoughts clearly and
elegantly.
