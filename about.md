Hello, I'm Yuhuan Qiu.

I study Computer Science mostly at Cornell in Ithaca, NY.

Currently, I'm a TA for CS 2800 - Discrete Structures, and an undergraduate
research assistant in computational biology.

In the past, I was a Summer Research Scholar at Children's Mercy Biomedical and
Health informatics department, working on an exome-seq meta analyses of ARDS,
where we discovered several SNPs and genes of interest for ARDS severity and
outcome.
